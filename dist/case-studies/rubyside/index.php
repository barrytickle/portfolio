      <h2>The brief</h2>
      <p>
        <b>
          The rubyside website is starting to look a little dated - <a href="http://rubyside.co.uk">http://rubyside.co.uk</a>. The home page should be redesigned to bring it up to date with the modern web page user interface trends. The goal of the page should be to get people to sign up to the event (via link to EventBrite). The logo and brand colours should remain the same but the page needs to look more vibrant and appeal more to Ruby developers by inheriting (but not stealing) traits of the Ruby on Rails brands.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Rubyside is a group of ruby on rails developers who provide events within the Liverpool area. The issue in which will be solved will be that the site is currently outdated within design. The aim of this build is to provide a more modern layout in which will invite users to take part within the events. This task will provide expansion of design skills, front-end responsive skills. To provide a suitable solution for this project, a replacement site will be designed, then built to propose a potential solution for the system itself.
      </p>

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        The main obstacle to overcome when designing this site is that there’s little imagery required for this type of design. The ﬁrst stages for this would be to look at pre-existing websites that discuss a similar topic to Rubyside, analyse the type of structure, icons that have been used throughout the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ﬁrst site which had been analysed to deﬁne a design for rubyside had been thoughtbot
      </p>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/rubyside/rubyside-desk-research.png" alt="Thoughtbot website">
      <p>
        Thoughtbot is a ruby driven website aimed towards ruby programmers, the use of colours split layouts and content deemed to be a route which rubyside should take. What was good about this website is that an equal contrast between images and content could be made, however when compared to the rubyside layout. The site itself is more content heavy, which may not be suitable for this type of layout. The next stages where to explore more split layouts which could be suitable for this type of design.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/rubyside/rubyside-desk-research-two.jpg" alt="Elegant themes website">
      <p>
        This layout by Elegant themes had provided more of a visual idea on how content could work in this style of layout. Using a similar colour scheme to the ruby red, this site will provide a closer result to what rubyside may look like.
      </p>
      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        For more of a front-end project, the tools which had been used to develop this site is SASS, GULP, HTML5. These tools allow the site to be developed mobile ﬁrst which can target a wider range of an audience for the site. The aim of the site will be inform users on what rubyside is, allow them to explore what events will be coming up. This is important to make the user aware on what events will be upcoming. To interpret this, the call to action will allow visitors to instantly view events, dependant on the reason for viewing the site. However the mouse indicator on the left will show the user there is more to see, and that they can scroll down.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/rubyside/rubyside-website-content.png" alt="Rubyside website content">
      <p>
        Towards the content of the website, the aim of the content was to introduce new users to what ruby is and how it works. This will apply to a target audience who is new to the programming language but is interested in learning more, it explains what the language is how it works. While also providing a simple example of the language which early-stage programmers can pick up on and interpret.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim of this section is to inform the users of the type of technologies used within the group, preparing the users with some beforehand knowledge before coming up to an event.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/rubyside/rubyside-website-team.png" alt="Rubyside website team section">
      <p>
        The aim of the team section is to familiarise the audience with a team section allowing the user to understand who they will be working with within the group. The team page will include a brief of who each staﬀ member is, what their role is. In comparison to the current rubyside website, the images where taken from the cleversteam site. As these images where higher quality and better represent the users of the group as they are more up to date photos.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        To conclude rubyside, the website is more modern, provides a more seperated structure. The end product aims to present the information to potential web developers while providing an emphasis towards the events in which Rubyside host.
