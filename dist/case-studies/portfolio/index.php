      <h2>The brief</h2>
      <p>
        <b>
          A portfolio must be created to allow potential clients and employees to showcase an example of what you can provide for them. The aim of a portfolio is designed to become a more interactive CV. Exploring the lifestyle of the developer, exploring their hobbies.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The ﬁnal build included will be a portfolio site, this site provides an overview of all previous work and highlights the personality of the web developer. The portfolio will consist of 5 diﬀerent pages, which will be from the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/portfolio/">Portfolio</a></li>
        <li><a href="/photography/">Photography</a></li>
        <li><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></li>
        <li><a href="/contact-us/">Contact us</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To begin the design process of the portfolio, ﬁrst there had been a check to understand what the current design trends are. The portfolio should become something unique, to show personality rather than a repeated design layout.
      </p>
      <h2>Desk research</h2>
      <p>
        To explore what current design trends are available, the following websites had been used: dribble.com, awwwards.com. These provide high quality designs which can be used for future development. To explore how to develop an eﬀective design which will work, existing portfolio’s will be explored. The ﬁrst site which had been explored was <a href="http://decojent.com/" target="_blank">http://decojent.com/</a>. This site is a creative agency, which provide a unique experience by changing the navigation menu.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/portfolio/personal-portfolio-desk-research-one.JPG" alt="Desk research one decojent">
      <p>
        This navigation menu is ﬁxed to the left hand side of the screen, showing the logo and a hamburger icon for the menu itself. However, on this site the menu will only appear on 1/3 on the screen, while this is good for User Experience, it had been badly implemented.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/portfolio/personal-portfolio-desk-research-two.JPG" alt="Desk research one decojent">
      <p>
        The second inspiration for the main feature of the site had come from: <a href="https://aaronmcguire.co.uk/">https://aaronmcguire.co.uk/</a>. Which is more of a student portfolio, oﬀering freelance services as a graduate web developer. This menu presented a better outcome as it had become fullscreen and provided a smoother transition for opening the menu. However, this menu seems too small and doesn’t appear to take up too much whitespace. However, implementing this style of menu would develop a unique experience for visitors within the site. This will be the initial aim of the portfolio user experience, the site will present more personality while ﬁnding a balance with user experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        When designing the portfolio, multiple iterations had been made to introduce how the site should ﬁrst appear on a desktop device. It is important to provide more of an understanding of how the site will look before implementing the look to code.
      </p>
      <h3>Design one</h3>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/portfolio/personal-portfolio-first-design.JPG" alt="Personal portfolio design one">
      <p>
        Design number one presents more of a plain experience, showing breadcrumbs to remind the user where they are on the site. However, this doesn’t appear to show much character to the site, only showing a title and a link. Since this site is small, the need for breadcrumbs is something which can be removed. However, the styling of the font and the logo had remained, due to a simplistic balance between serif and sans-serif fonts.
      </p>
      <h3>Design two</h3>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/portfolio/personal-portfolio-second-design.JPG" alt="Personal portfolio design two">
      <p>
        Design two had become a more plain design, however this had started to adapt to more of a similar design to how this had come around now. The navigation bar was still yet to be explored, however the content and colours are becoming more accurate to how the ﬁnal design had appeared to be.
      </p>

      <h3>Design three</h3>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/portfolio/personal-portfolio-third-design.JPG" alt="Personal portfolio design three">

      <p>
        Design three is the ﬁnal iteration of the portfolio design, using the wave was an idea towards implementing a newer trend of web design. (Muzli, 2017) had explained that wavy designs are making a trend in the current web design, displaying sites that have obscure patterns or show a diﬀerent structure than the standard ”Box” layout. This had been explored to show an understanding of trying something new within front-end design.
      </p>
      <p>
        This would have been done to show that there is an understanding of the current web trends. However, this design would leave a diﬃcult opportunity to present content within the home section, leaving a white-space which not much content may take advantage of. This design had been further expanded to the standard block design, as this is more expandable for future development.
      </p>

      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/portfolio/personal-portfolio-navigation.JPG" alt="Personal portfolio navigation-design">
      <p>
        Designing the navigation of the project is important as it will be the main element the user will use to explore content within the site. In addition to the desk research mentioned earlier, it will be ideal to expand and explore white-space opportunities to work well with the design itself. As shown, all links will be split within the middle, allowing the user to pick their options. However, in addition to the links, a small phrase will be introduced to summarise what each page will be composed of. The aim of this navigation menu is to show some design and front-end skills to a potential employer. The design itself will introduce navigation to display the links, fading each link in one-by-one.
      </p>

      <h2>Fonts and Colour Scheme</h2>
      <p>
        To deﬁne the aim of the portfolio, the website has been designed to remain professional yet creative. This had been controlled through the use of font choices and colour schemes. To deﬁne the fonts for the website, a mixture of serif and sans-serif fonts where used. A mixture of both remains professional while being easier to read. Using a serif font for bolder titles made the site stand out more with the aim to not look like a standard serif font. This provides a creative element to the site which can also remain professional. With a mixture of a sans-serif font, the contrast between the two provides an easier to read interface which distinguishes bolder titles from standard content.
      </p>
      <p>
        To deﬁne the colour scheme for the website, a darker grey and a red colour was used as a professional tone to the website. Due to many portfolio sites using a standard white colour, they had appeared to look too bright with the navigation menu blending in within any content elements to the site. To solve this problem, a darker navigation bar with a red navigation menu had been used to reduce the strain and to distinguish the content from the navigation menu itself.
      </p>
      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>
        All photos used throughout the site had been taken by myself. This has been done to express a passion for a hobby which will also be introduced within the site.
      </p>

      <h2>Design and implementation</h2>
      <h3>Landing page</h3>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/portfolio/personal-portfolio-design-final.jpg" alt="Personal portfolio Landing page">
      <p>
        The first final design of the portfolio, will include a professional image of
myself in my current workplace. The aim of this is to show employers that
I am a professional individual who works to meet high-standards. The text
within the design will aim to show the user who the developer is, with an
introductory paragraph explaining what can be done. Following this, two
call to action links will determine the two main points within the website.
For this design, the call to action links can send users to the case-study pages
or straight to the contact page.
      </p>
      <h3>Navigation menu</h3>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/portfolio/personal-portfolio-navigation-bar.jpg" alt="Personal portfolio Navigation Bar">
      <p>
        To suit the style and the layout of the colour scheme, the navigation bar
had been changed to a darker grey and red colour scheme. The navigation
bar has been switched to the professional serif font which will be a recurring
theme throughout the website itself.
      </p>
      <h3>Case study home</h3>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/portfolio/personal-portfolio-case-study-home.jpg" alt="Personal portfolio case study home">
      <p>
        The case study home will provide an overall view of each individual project.
The thought process behind this page is to provide the user with a clean
vector logo which is designed to cause curiosity behind each project. Each
project will have their own individual summary which will be open to the
user before entering the page. The thought behind this is to introduce the
user to each project, before even needing to view the page. Giving the user a
brief overview and a visit of the website may be all a user will need to show
a user the work behind a project.
      </p>
      <h3>Case study page</h3>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/portfolio/personal-portfolio-case-study-page.jpg" alt="Personal portfolio case study page">
      <p>
        The aim behind a case study page is to provide the user with a journey
of the thought process behind each project. As shown in the picture above,
the user will be given a colour scheme and a font-family for each project.
This is aimed towards freelance project as it will provide clients with inspiration
over how they would like their own products to look. The case study
page will also provide a quicklink bar placed within the top of the page, this
will provide users with a navigation link to show them what project will be
next, and what project will be previous. While also providing the user with
a quicklink to the project website at any time. The main aim for this page
is to always provide a call to action for the user to easily navigate through
all existing projects.
      </p>
      <h3>Photography page</h3>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/portfolio/personal-portfolio-photography.jpg" alt="Personal portfolio Photography page">
      <p>
        For the photography page, the main aim of this is to show users what photos
have been taken, providing an option to expand upon these photos. This
page works by using an instagram API library (instafeed.js), which will take
all photos from an instagram feed containing a certain tag ”photography”.
Instagram is the most suitable CMS for this type of project, as it is a more
natural interface which can be accessed quickly during any time. Sharing
social media will also be a quick way for users to get into contact throughout
the website. Similar code can also be located on the photography section
within the home page, only showing the 3 latest posts upon loading the website.
This is designed to save on the loading speed of the page, by limiting
the search to the three latest photos.
      </p>
      <h3>Blog page</h3>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/portfolio/personal-portfolio-blog.jpg" alt="Personal portfolio Blog page">
      <p>
        The blog within the website is designed to show the latest post as a featured
image block. To develop the blog, WordPress has been used, this is
to demonstrate skills within developing a bespoke custom wordpress theme,
while also developing a user friendly cms to update the blog with relevant
blog posts. This page is aimed to show any inspiration within the portfolio,
while also giving potential employers a chance to explore what topics of
interest is available.
      </p>
      <h3>Contact page</h3>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/portfolio/personal-portfolio-contact.JPG" alt="Personal portfolio contact page">
      <p>
        The contact page allows potential clients or employers to get in touch throughout
the website. As shown on the image above, validation has taken place
within the contact form, this uses validation known as parsley.js. This
lightweight javascript file requires all the functional validation needed to ensure
that the user enters the correct details within the form. When a user
doesn’t enter details into the required fields, the box will turn into a red
colour. This is done to symbolize an error has happened within a particular
field.

      </p>
      <p>
        However, once the user has corrected their mistake, the javascript file
will turn green to provide feedback to the user that they have entered the
correct information. Upon submitting the form, the user will be redirected
to a thank you page which will confirm that the user has been able to submit
the message.

      </p>
      <h3>Footer</h3>
      <img src="/images/portfolio/web-design/portfolio/personal-portfolio-footer.PNG" alt="Personal portfolio contact page">

      <p>
        The footer of the portfolio is important as it will hold all call to action
links within the site itself. The left side of the footer contains a section for
freelance clients. Allowing them to start a journey through the site itself,
this will redirect them to the contact page where they can enquire about a
possible future project. On the right, the box will ask about being hired
which is directed at potential future employers.
      </p>
      <p>
        To add some additional interaction to this element, on hover the images
behind the boxes will become brighter and more zoomed out. The affect on
hover is to symbolize that a positive effect will happen if the user makes that
particular choice
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to this, to aid SEO a small description is present with a
location to tell Google where the developer is located. This is to aid a
search result if a user was to look for ”Web developer newton-le-willows”.
In addition to this, quicklinks are also present to particular objects such as
a CV, resources (courses that have been done, books that have been read,
previous work experience). And a contact link, as the main aim for this site
is to convert users into contacting through the portfolio site itself.
